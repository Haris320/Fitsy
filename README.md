## Run

Fitsy uses Firebase to track user data and create accounts that help make it easier for them to get in shape. The run feature takes the user through a series of stretching exercises before tracking how long they run and walk.

## Swim

The swim feature allows the user to store their times for freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly. They can then update their times as the improve, encouraging them to give it their all every time. It also provides video instructions to insure that our users have proper form and avoid any injuries
